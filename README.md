# RaceGo
A stationary nodebot that is a race control system for hot wheels drag racing. This does work but it also needs work. This system has a controller to control each lane. Each controller is just a breadboard with 1 button and its "side" of the start tree (from top to bottom yellow, yellow, green, red) The tree is activated and the tree lights up in similar fashion to your standard drag racing xmas tree. If you go too early you foul out other wise a servo will open your lane's start gate and your r/t is recorded. The race finish is picked up by IR led beams. The race results data is sent to a Nodejs Express webserver on the Tessel and you view the race results on a phone, tablet or laptop connected to the same wifi ssid.
